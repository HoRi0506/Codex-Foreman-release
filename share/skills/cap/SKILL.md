# $cap

Use when the operator invokes `$cap`. Remove the literal `$cap` token and route the remaining request through CCC.

## Model

Public flow: `captain -> Way -> captain -> specialist -> captain -> ... -> end`.

- Host Codex is the public `captain`.
- CCC owns persisted LongWay, task-cards, routing, visibility, and fallback truth.
- Specialists are internal executors selected from `ccc-config.toml`.
- Prefer Codex custom subagents over detached `codex exec`; keep `codex exec` as explicit fallback only.
- `/agent` is inspection/thread switching only, not the orchestrator.
- Do not let one specialist hand off directly to another; always return to captain.
- For ordinary `$cap`, do not call `mcp__ccc__...` tools. Use the local `ccc` CLI; MCP is diagnostics-only unless the operator asks for it.

## Compact Loop

Use compact CLI surfaces by default. Full JSON/status is debug-only.

1. Ensure a meaningful request remains after `$cap`; otherwise ask one concise clarification.
2. Verify workspace write support once with `test -w .`.
3. If not writable, state CCC needs workspace-write, then stop or do one visible read-only fallback if the request is read-only.
4. Start with one bounded Way checkpoint:
   `ccc start --json '{"prompt":"<request>","title":"<short>","intent":"<short>","goal":"<short>","scope":"<bounded>","acceptance":"<done when>","task_kind":"way","compact":true}'`
5. For decisions, use:
   `ccc status --json '{"run_id":"<run_id>","compact":true}'`
6. Use `command_templates` from compact status. Do not run `ccc ... --help`, broad `rg`, or session-history searches to discover syntax.
7. If `preferred_specialist_execution_mode=codex_subagent` and a custom agent is available, use that subagent first.
8. Follow `subagent_spawn_contract`: use the named custom agent, avoid full-history fork, and omit agent/model/reasoning overrides already defined by the custom agent.
9. Record lifecycle with CLI, not MCP, when requested:
   `ccc subagent-update --json '{...,"compact":true}'`
10. Required lifecycle order: `spawned -> completed|failed|stalled -> merged`.
11. Subagent fan-in must be compact structured data:
   `summary`, `status`, `evidence_paths`, `next_action`, `open_questions`, `confidence`.
12. If `codex_exec_fallback_allowed=false`, do not call `ccc orchestrate` as fallback for that task-card until a terminal subagent update or explicit `fallback_reason` is recorded.
13. Replan/resolve through compact orchestrate templates:
   `ccc orchestrate --json '{...,"compact":true}'`
14. Reply only when complete, blocked, or waiting on a real operator decision. Do not print the final answer twice.

## Routing

Use CCC-managed custom agents when available:

- `ccc_tactician`: Way/planning
- `ccc_scout`: read-only repo/workspace evidence
- `ccc_raider`: bounded code/config mutation
- `ccc_scribe`: docs/operator text
- `ccc_arbiter`: optional risk/acceptance review
- `ccc_sentinel`: ownership/path classification
- `ccc_companion_reader`: lightweight read-only tool-routed work
- `ccc_companion_operator`: lightweight mutation/operator-side work

Do not route to generic helper agents when a matching CCC specialist exists.

## Discipline

- Keep captain messages short; do not paste full CCC JSON into public updates.
- Use `ccc activity` only for diagnostics when compact status lacks necessary truth.
- Avoid broad host-local repo inspection unless CCC visibly degrades.
- Mutation/review work belongs to specialists, not captain, unless fallback is explicit.
- On stalls, prefer CCC reclaim/retry/reassign before degraded host-local fallback.
- `arbiter` is optional; use it only for real risk, ambiguity, failed tests, or release-critical judgment.
- Stored LongWay text should stay English; answer the operator in their language.
