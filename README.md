<p align="center"><em>Want to run Codex CLI or Codex App end-to-end?<br>
Worried about running the whole thing on high-end models?<br>

Then something remarkable can unfold.</em></p>

Current public release: `0.0.1`.

CCC is a captain-first orchestration layer for Codex CLI. It keeps `$cap` as the only public entrypoint, persists LongWay/task-card/fan-in state, and routes specialist work through configured `ccc_*` agents before captain review.

## Install, Update, Uninstall

Primary install path:

```text
Install Codex-Cli-Captain with Cargo:
cargo install codex-cli-captain

After installation finishes, run:
ccc setup

Then fully exit Codex CLI.
Start a new Codex CLI session.
Then run:
ccc check-install
```

To update an existing Cargo install, rerun:

```text
cargo install codex-cli-captain --force
ccc setup
```

Then fully restart Codex CLI and run `ccc check-install`.

To uninstall the Cargo-installed binary:

```text
cargo uninstall codex-cli-captain
```

If you also want CCC-managed cleanup, run `ccc uninstall --dry-run` first to review the plan, then `ccc uninstall --confirm` only if the preview is correct. Use `ccc check-install` before removing MCP registration, `ccc-config.toml`, skills, or custom agents.

Windows PowerShell uses the same primary Cargo path.

Legacy release-bundle fallback only:

macOS or Linux:

```text
Install Codex-Cli-Captain from https://github.com/HoRi0506/Codex-Cli-Captain-Release by running:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HoRi0506/Codex-Cli-Captain-Release/main/install.sh | bash

After installation finishes, fully exit Codex CLI.
Start a new Codex CLI session.
Then run:
ccc check-install
```

Windows PowerShell:

```text
Install Codex-Cli-Captain from https://github.com/HoRi0506/Codex-Cli-Captain-Release by running:
iwr -UseB https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HoRi0506/Codex-Cli-Captain-Release/main/install.ps1 | iex

After installation finishes, fully exit Codex CLI.
Start a new Codex CLI session.
Then run:
ccc check-install
```

To update, rerun `cargo install codex-cli-captain --force` and then `ccc setup`, fully restart Codex CLI, and run `ccc check-install`. Use the legacy release-bundle installer only when you intentionally want the packaged `install.sh`/`install.ps1` fallback. The bundle installer stages the new bundle before switching the active path, preserves previous release bundles for rollback, refreshes CCC-managed plugin and `$cap` files, and only cleans CCC-managed stale cache/version entries plus the legacy packaged cap copy. Non-CCC Codex config is preserved. `cargo publish` is maintainer-only release work that needs the release token and approval outside this end-user README.

Release installers are pinned to `v0.0.1` by default. Set `CCC_VERSION` only when you intentionally want a different release.

## Basic Use

Start a CCC-managed task by adding `$cap` before your request:

```text
$cap Refactor the auth flow and keep tests passing
```

CCC owns persisted LongWay, task cards, checklist/projection, fan-in, status, and restart handoff. Host `/plan`, `/goal`, and graph commands are not CCC public entrypoints.

## Reapply Config Changes

Edit `~/.config/ccc/ccc-config.toml` to change each CCC role's model, reasoning tier, and fast-mode setting. After editing, paste this into Codex CLI:

```text
Run:
ccc setup

Then fully exit Codex CLI.
Start a new Codex CLI session.
Then run:
ccc check-install
```

`ccc setup` preserves user-customized values while backfilling missing generated defaults and refreshing MCP registration, the packaged `$cap` skill, and CCC-managed custom agents.

## Recommended Role Defaults

For regular CCC use, ChatGPT Pro $100 is the recommended starting plan because `$cap` workflows can spend more Codex usage through repeated captain and specialist handoffs.

| CCC role | Stable agent ID | Display callsign | Recommended model | Reasoning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `orchestrator` | `captain` | `Captain` | `gpt-5.5` | `medium` | Host-owned routing label, not a managed `ccc_*` specialist |
| `way` | `ccc_tactician` | `Executor` | `gpt-5.5` | `high` | Planning and bounded next-move selection |
| `explorer` | `ccc_scout` | `Observer` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | `high` | Read-only repo evidence |
| `code specialist` | `ccc_raider` | `Marauder` | `gpt-5.5` | `high` | Code/config mutation and repair |
| `documenter` | `ccc_scribe` | `Adjutant` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | `medium` | README and operator text |
| `verifier` | `ccc_arbiter` | `Arbiter` | `gpt-5.5` | `high` | Captain-mediated review, risk, regression, and acceptance checks |
| `sentinel` | `ccc_sentinel` | `Overseer` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | `high` | Run-scoped guardrail classification and status visibility |
| `companion_reader` | `ccc_companion_reader` | `Probe` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | `medium` | Low-cost filesystem/docs/web/git/gh read work |
| `companion_operator` | `ccc_companion_operator` | `SCV` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | `medium` | Low-cost bounded git/gh mutation and narrow tool work |

Stable `ccc_*` IDs are routing truth. StarCraft callsigns are display-only.
